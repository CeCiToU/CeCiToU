# üí´ About Me:
I am a 12th-grade student currently studying mathematics and physics. Alongside my academic pursuits, I am in my last year at SoftUni, where I have been expanding my knowledge and skills in various areas of programming. My true passion lies in programming, and I thoroughly enjoy utilizing Arduino to create systems and projects that leverage my programming skills and incorporate electronic components. Through my studies, I have acquired skills in circuit design, prototyping, and programming Arduino boards, allowing me to develop functional electronic systems. To showcase my projects and contribute to the community, I maintain this GitHub profile where I share code samples, collaborate with others, and demonstrate my interests in programming, mathematics, and physics. Looking towards the future, I am excited to continue exploring the intersection of programming, electronics, and scientific principles, with potential career paths in fields such as electrical engineering, applied physics, artificial intelligence, or research and development in cutting-edge technologies.
