# üí´ About Me
I am a second-year **Cybersecurity student** at the Technical University of Sofia, with a strong foundation in programming, mathematics, and physics. My passion lies at the intersection of **technology, problem-solving, and innovation**, which drives my interest in software development, hardware projects, and cybersecurity.

I have worked on a variety of projects, including:

- **Lithophane Moonlight (Moon Lamp)**: A customizable RGB moon lamp built from lithophane art. Controlled with potentiometers, it comes in two variants: with auto shutoff (fades out after 3 hours) or without auto shutoff (stays on until manually powered off).

- **Both Sides of the Coin**: An educational interactive tool illustrating the duality of concepts through real-world scenarios and visualizations.  
- **Interactive Solar System (ISS)**: Dynamic visualization of the solar system for better understanding of planetary motion and spatial relationships.  
- **Pixelator**: A creative tool to convert images into pixel art.  
- **PlanMe**: A versatile planning app for schedules, shopping lists, and more, featuring daily inspirational quotes from thinkers like Albert Einstein.  

I aim to combine my skills in **software and hardware development** with **cybersecurity principles** to create secure, robust, and innovative solutions. I am also passionate about contributing to **open-source projects**, collaborating with like-minded professionals, and continuously learning to stay at the forefront of technology.

Looking ahead, I plan to explore **cybersecurity, secure software engineering, and tech innovation**, while focusing on building impactful and reliable solutions.
